## Getting Started.

Make sure you have nodejs installed by running the following command:

```bash
node -v
```

If the output is not the version of your nodejs installation, install nodejs from [here](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)

After installing nodejs install [yarn](https://www.npmjs.com/package/yarn) if you don't have it installed then run `yarn` or `yarn install` to install all the project's dependencies:


## STARTING THE DEVELOPMENT SERVER
```bash
yarn start
```

Runs the app in the development mode.
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

## RUNNING YARN COMMANDS

To add a dependency, run.
### `yarn add [package]`

To remove a dependency, run.

### `yarn remove [package] `

## Editor setup

We're using eslint for linting and prettier for code formating, make sure you install eslint and prettier plugins in your editor so you can
see linting errors as you code and have your code formatted on save by prettier. If formatOnSave doesn't work please google how to set up
format on save for the eslint & prettier plugins in your editor ðŸ™ƒ

## Project structure
